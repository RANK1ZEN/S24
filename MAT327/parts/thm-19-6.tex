\begin{problem}[Theorem 19.6]
    Let $f : A \to \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ be given by the equation
    \begin{equation}
        f(a) = (f_\alpha(a))_{\alpha \in J},
    \end{equation}
    where $f_\alpha : A \to X_\alpha$ for each $\alpha$.
    Let $\prod X_\alpha$ have the product topology.
    Then the function $f$ is continuous if and only if each function $f_\alpha$ is continuous.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
    In general $f_\alpha = \pi_\alpha \circ f$, in which by assumption of continuity of $f$ makes $f_\alpha$ also continuous, as it is the composition of two continuous functions.
    \footnote{This holds for both product and box.}

    In the converse statement, we will have the apply the properties of the product.
    \footnote{To show $f$ is continuous, we can show that the preimages of subbasic sets are open.}
    Let $\pi_\beta^{-1}(V_\beta)$ be a general subbasis
    \footnote{The product topology is generated by subbasis
        \begin{equation*}
            \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} \{ \pi_\beta^{-1}(U_\alpha) : U_\alpha \text{ is open in } X_\alpha \}.
        \end{equation*}
    }
    element in $X$,
    where $V_\beta$ is open in $X_\beta$.
    Like the first implication, the preimage is also open since
    $f^{-1}(\pi_\beta^{-1}(V_\beta)) = f_\beta^{-1}(V_\beta)$, which is open.
\end{proof}
